            <p>At St. Clair,
               the research projects I work on encompass both innovative engineering challenges and community-focused initiatives.
                For example, the Baja project involves designing and constructing 
                an off-road vehicle to compete in the international Baja SAE competitions,
                 where the team experiments with materials, testing methods, and design improvements to enhance speed,
                  durability, and handling. Meanwhile, the LaSalle project focuses on collaborative problem-solving,
                   working closely with the local community or municipal partners to address real-world issues,
                    improve infrastructure, and develop sustainable solutions.</p>
